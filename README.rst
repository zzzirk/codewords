A simple python library that returns a code "phrase" or a pair of code words.

History
=======
I needed the ability to generate a "codename" or "code phrase" awhile back.
I decided it would be a fun little project to write up as a re-usable
library in the event that I ever need such functionality again.

The library is in a pretty basic state currently, but it isn't really
rocket science to begin with.  I will work on getting some basic docs
written up and included at some point.
