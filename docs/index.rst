   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the CodeWords library
================================
The :py:mod:`codewords` library got its start when I needed a silly code phrase
for something.  I don't even remember what for, but I threw this together.
After a few months I ran across the library and figured I'd clean it up a
bit, throw together a small bit of documentation and release it upon the
unsuspecting world.  So without further ado, I hereby give you the
:py:mod:`codewords` library.
